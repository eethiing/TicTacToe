# TicTacToe

## Description
-------------
Tic Tac Toe is a game between two players traditionally using paper and pencil. It is a simple
game that many people understand and implement as a beginner project using different kinds
of programming languages. The players are supposed to mark the squares in a three-by-three
grid alternately. The winner is determined when one of the players has successfully placed
their mark either horizontally,vertically or diagonally on all three grids. The game will end
when all the boxes are filled, and if there is no winner, it will be a game that ends with a
draw. In this project, we are going to build a simple Tic Tac Toe game by using Lisp
programming language.
